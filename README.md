## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To run tests run `rake` or `rspec`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing
You need to have set these ENV variables:
```bash
ENDPOINT=               # Url to admin pages
PROVIDER_KEY=           # Provider key
SERVICE_ID=             # Echo service Id
METRIC_ID=              # Metric Id
